Learn Basic Conic Section Thingos

## Latest Stable
Currently, the latest stable only has one option, "_Conic Blitz_", and it is finally distributable!
Functionalities remain. We have included a _lecture notes_ page for our audience to learn about conic sections; unfortunately, it is still under development.

We hope to see you along with the future releases soon!
