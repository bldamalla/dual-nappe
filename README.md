Learn Basic Conic Section Thingos

## Latest Stable
Currently, the latest stable only has one option, "_Conic Blitz_", and it is still in beta.
The proponents of the game are currently trying to make gameplay better and to make learning basic conic sections fun and rewarding!

We hope to see you with the final release, with the _teacher stamp of approval_ release soon.
